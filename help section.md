There are three difficulty levels: 3 times 3, 4 times 4, and 5 times 5. 
3 by 3 is a total of 9 squares, need to move 1 to 8 eight numbers; 
4 by 4 is a total of 16 squares, need to move 1 to 15 fifteen numbers;
5 by 5 is a total of 25 squares, need to move 1 to 24 twenty-four numbers.
Before introducing the steps, let's talk about the rules of the game, which are as follows:
  1.The numbers are entirely disordered at the beginning.
  2.One number is moved at a time.
  3.All the numbers are restored in order in the end.
Let's start with the simplest three-by-three to talk about the steps. 
There are 9 squares, and then only eight of them hold the number boards, 1-8, with one space in them.
We can slide the board around to change its position on the grid.
If you move the number pad to a space, the original number pad becomes a space again, and you can move the number pad next to the space.
The ultimate goal is to arrange the number boards in order from 1-8, top to bottom and left to right in order of number size by moving them around. 
Of course, 3 by 3 is only a beginner's guide, and the difficulty level slowly increases. 4 by 4 and 5 by 5 are the rules, and so on.
